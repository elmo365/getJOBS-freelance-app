<h2 id="4-interview-coach-practice-with-ai">🤖 4. INTERVIEW COACH - PRACTICE WITH AI</h2>
<h3 id="what-it-is_2">What It Is</h3>
<p>An AI coach that generates interview questions specific to the job you're applying for and gives you feedback on your answers.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works_1">How It Works</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Setup the Practice Session</strong></p>
<pre><code>Tell the AI:
• What job are you interviewing for?
  (e.g., &quot;Software Developer&quot;)

• What company? (optional)
  (e.g., &quot;Google&quot; - helps personalize questions)

• What's your experience level?
  • Junior (new to field)
  • Mid-level (some experience)
  • Senior (lots of experience)

• What skills should we focus on?
  (e.g., Python, React, Leadership)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: AI Generates Questions</strong></p>
<pre><code>You get 5 interview questions like:
1. &quot;Tell me about a project where you...&quot;
2. &quot;How do you handle difficult team members?&quot;
3. &quot;Describe a time you failed...&quot;
4. etc.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Practice Your Answers</strong></p>
<pre><code>For each question:
• Read the question
• Type your answer in the text box
• Review what you wrote
• Click &quot;Get Feedback&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4: AI Evaluates Your Answer</strong></p>
<pre><code>The AI coach gives you:
✓ What you did well
✓ What you could improve
✓ How to better answer that question
✓ Example of a better answer
</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-questions-does-ai-ask">What Questions Does AI Ask?</h3>
<p>The AI creates questions based on:
- <strong>Job Type:</strong> Software Dev questions are different from Sales questions
- <strong>Company:</strong> If you mention Google vs. startup, questions change
- <strong>Level:</strong> Junior gets simpler questions, Senior gets harder ones
- <strong>Skills:</strong> If you mention Python, you get Python questions</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-better-at-interviews">How to Get Better at Interviews</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practice regularly</strong> - Do 5 questions a day</li>
<li><strong>Try different scenarios</strong> - Practice for different jobs</li>
<li><strong>Learn from feedback</strong> - Read what the AI suggests</li>
<li><strong>Repeat hard questions</strong> - Practice ones you struggle with</li>
<li><strong>Review your progress</strong> - See how you improve over time</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="interview-categories">Interview Categories</h3>
<p>The AI asks different types of questions:
- <strong>Behavioral</strong> ("Tell me about a time when...")
- <strong>Technical</strong> (Job-specific skills)
- <strong>Problem-solving</strong> (How would you approach...)
- <strong>Company knowledge</strong> (Why do you want to work here?)</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="5-ai-job-matching-find-your-perfect-job">🎯 5. AI JOB MATCHING - FIND YOUR PERFECT JOB</h2>
<h3 id="what-it-is_3">What It Is</h3>
<p>An intelligent system that looks through thousands of jobs and finds the ones that match YOU perfectly.</p>
<h3 id="important-requirements">Important Requirements</h3>
<p>✅ <strong>You MUST have:</strong>
1. A completed CV
2. Skills listed in your CV
3. Experience information filled in</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Without these, job matching won't work.</strong></p>
<h3 id="how-ai-matching-works">How AI Matching Works</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: System Analyzes You</strong></p>
<pre><code>The system looks at:
• Your skills (Python, Excel, etc.)
• Your experience level
• Your education
• Your job preferences
• Your location
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Two-Stage Matching Process</strong></p>
<pre><code>Stage 1: Quick Filter
─────────────────────
• Looks at ALL available jobs
• Quick checks: skills match, location, level
• Keeps only the best 30 matches
• (Faster than analyzing all jobs)

Stage 2: AI Ranking
─────────────────────
• AI looks closely at the 30 jobs
• Considers: skill match quality, growth opportunity,
  company type, job type (remote/office)
• Ranks them from best to worst
• Shows you the top ranked jobs
