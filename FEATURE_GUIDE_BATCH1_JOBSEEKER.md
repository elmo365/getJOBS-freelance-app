## 🎥 3. VIDEO RESUME

A short video introduction of yourself for employers to watch instead of (or in addition to) reading your CV.

### How to Use Video Resume

**Upload Your Video:**
```
1. Open "Video Resume" section

2. Click "Select Video"
   ↓

### Video Tips
- **Length:** 30 seconds to 2 minutes ideal
- **Content:** Introduce yourself, say what you do, why you're great
- **Quality:** Good lighting, clear audio, professional look

### How Employers See It

## 🤖 4. INTERVIEW COACH - PRACTICE WITH AI

### What It Is
An AI coach that generates interview questions specific to the job you're applying for and gives you feedback on your answers.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Setup the Practice Session**
```
Tell the AI:
• What job are you interviewing for?
  (e.g., "Software Developer")
  
• What company? (optional)
  (e.g., "Google" - helps personalize questions)
  
• What's your experience level?
  • Junior (new to field)
  • Mid-level (some experience)
  • Senior (lots of experience)
  
• What skills should we focus on?
  (e.g., Python, React, Leadership)
```

**Step 2: AI Generates Questions**
```
You get 5 interview questions like:
1. "Tell me about a project where you..."
2. "How do you handle difficult team members?"
3. "Describe a time you failed..."
4. etc.
```

**Step 3: Practice Your Answers**
```
For each question:
• Read the question
• Type your answer in the text box
• Review what you wrote
• Click "Get Feedback"
```

**Step 4: AI Evaluates Your Answer**
```
The AI coach gives you:
✓ What you did well
✓ What you could improve
✓ How to better answer that question
✓ Example of a better answer
```

### What Questions Does AI Ask?

The AI creates questions based on:
- **Job Type:** Software Dev questions are different from Sales questions
- **Company:** If you mention Google vs. startup, questions change
- **Level:** Junior gets simpler questions, Senior gets harder ones
- **Skills:** If you mention Python, you get Python questions

### How to Get Better at Interviews
1. **Practice regularly** - Do 5 questions a day
2. **Try different scenarios** - Practice for different jobs
3. **Learn from feedback** - Read what the AI suggests
4. **Repeat hard questions** - Practice ones you struggle with
5. **Review your progress** - See how you improve over time

### Interview Categories
The AI asks different types of questions:
- **Behavioral** ("Tell me about a time when...")
- **Technical** (Job-specific skills)
- **Problem-solving** (How would you approach...)
- **Company knowledge** (Why do you want to work here?)

## 🎯 5. AI JOB MATCHING - FIND YOUR PERFECT JOB

### What It Is
An intelligent system that looks through thousands of jobs and finds the ones that match YOU perfectly.

### Important Requirements
✅ **You MUST have:**
1. A completed CV
2. Skills listed in your CV
3. Experience information filled in

❌ **Without these, job matching won't work.**

### How AI Matching Works

**Step 1: System Analyzes You**
```
The system looks at:
• Your skills (Python, Excel, etc.)
• Your experience level
• Your education
• Your job preferences
• Your location
```

**Step 2: Two-Stage Matching Process**
```
Stage 1: Quick Filter
─────────────────────
• Looks at ALL available jobs
• Quick checks: skills match, location, level
• Keeps only the best 30 matches
• (Faster than analyzing all jobs)

Stage 2: AI Ranking
─────────────────────
• AI looks closely at the 30 jobs
• Considers: skill match quality, growth opportunity,
  company type, job type (remote/office)
• Ranks them from best to worst
• Shows you the top ranked jobs
```

### What You See

```

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Match Score Explained
- **95%** = Excellent match, most of your skills match the job
- **75-88%** = Good match, several of your skills match
- **60-74%** = Okay match, some skills match, room to grow
- **Below 60%** = Stretch job, you'd be learning on the job

### Why Two-Stage Matching?
1. **Faster** - Don't waste time analyzing jobs you're not suited for
2. **Better** - AI only compares similar jobs, makes smarter decisions
3. **Accurate** - Heuristic filter + AI ranking = best results
4. **Smart** - Just like how you'd search yourself

### What Makes a Good Match?
- ✅ Skills match (you have what they want)
- ✅ Experience level right (not too junior, not too senior)
- ✅ Location works (remote if you want it)
- ✅ Job type fits (full-time if you need stability)
- ✅ Company reputation (good ratings from other workers)
