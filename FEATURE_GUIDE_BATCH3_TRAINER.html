<h2 id="critical-notice-please-read-first">⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE - PLEASE READ FIRST</h2>
<p><strong>Trainer Features Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED</strong></p>
<p>This app has trainer features, but <strong>they are NOT fully complete yet</strong>. Some features work well, while others have limitations or incomplete backend functionality.</p>
<p><strong>What Works:</strong>
- ✅ Trainer dashboard and basic profiles
- ✅ View students and mentees
- ✅ Complete job history and ratings</p>
<p><strong>What Is Limited/Incomplete:</strong>
- ⚠️ Live sessions (UI exists, backend connections incomplete)
- ⚠️ Messaging to students (basic functionality only)
- ⚠️ Course materials (limited upload/download features)
- ⚠️ Student progress tracking (basic stats only)</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>
If you're a trainer planning to use this heavily, be aware these features are still being developed. For now, they're good for basic management, but not for a full training platform.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>
For now, use external tools (Google Drive, Dropbox) for file sharing.<br />
Link to those resources in the app instead of uploading directly.</p>

<h3 id="session-types">Session Types</h3>
<p><strong>1-on-1 Sessions</strong>
- Private training
- Just you and one student
- Focused and personal
- Most expensive for students</p>
<p><strong>Group Sessions</strong>
- Train multiple students
- More affordable
- Good for lectures
- Less personalized</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-during-a-session">What Happens During a Session</h3>
<p><strong>Before:</strong>
- Connect 5 minutes early
- Test audio/video
- Prepare materials
- Greet student warmly</p>
<p><strong>During:</strong>
- Teach your material
- Answer questions
- Use screen sharing (if working)
- Keep good pace</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong>
- Summarize key points
- Assign homework
- Schedule next session
- Thank student</p>
<h3 id="current-issues">Current Issues ⚠️</h3>
<p><strong>Known Problems:</strong>
- ⚠️ Audio/video quality can be inconsistent
- ⚠️ Session recording may not work
- ⚠️ Screen sharing has occasional issues
- ⚠️ Connection drops reported sometimes
- ⚠️ No integrated chat (have to use external tools)</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong>
Use Zoom, Google Meet, or WhatsApp video for better reliability.<br />
The app can be used just for scheduling and payment.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<p><strong>For Successful Sessions:</strong>
1. Use external video tool (Zoom/Meet)
2. Have internet backup ready
3. Keep sessions to scheduled time
4. Always get student's feedback
5. Take notes on student progress

<h2 id="common-questions">🆘 COMMON QUESTIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Why is my session quality so bad?</strong><br />
A: Backend connections are incomplete. Use external video tools (Zoom/Meet) instead for better quality.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I upload my course materials?</strong><br />
A: Upload system is basic and unreliable. Better to use Google Drive and link to it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long until payment arrives?</strong><br />
A: Pending → Paid takes 3 business days. Check your bank account 4 days after session.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can students message me directly?</strong><br />
A: Yes, but messaging is very basic. Use WhatsApp or email for important communication.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I get better ratings?</strong><br />
A: Be professional, teach clearly, respond quickly, and deliver value. Good ratings build naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I increase my hourly rate?</strong><br />
A: Yes, anytime. But high rates may deter new students. Increase gradually as ratings improve.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if a student wants a refund?</strong><br />
A: System allows refunds. Contact support to process. You keep nothing on refunded sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I run group sessions?</strong><br />
A: The feature exists but group session system is not fully implemented. Better for 1-on-1 training for now.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I track student progress?</strong><br />
A: App has basic stats. Keep your own detailed records separately using spreadsheet or document.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is this a full LMS (Learning Management System)?</strong><br />
A: No. Use it for scheduling and payments. For full course delivery, use proper LMS platforms like Teachable, Udemy, or Moodle.</p>

<h2 id="final-recommendation">🎓 FINAL RECOMMENDATION</h2>
<p><strong>This trainer feature is good for:</strong>
- Scheduling training sessions
- Managing student relationships
- Handling payments
- Building your reputation through ratings</p>
<p><strong>This trainer feature is NOT good for:</strong>
- Running a full online school
- Hosting video content
- Comprehensive course delivery
- Advanced student tracking</p>
<p><strong>Best Approach:</strong>
Use this app as your <strong>scheduling and payment platform</strong>.<br />
Use <strong>external tools</strong> for everything else:
- Zoom or Google Meet for sessions
- Google Drive for course materials
- Email/WhatsApp for communication
- Google Sheets for progress tracking</p>
<p>This gives you the best of both worlds:
- Professional features on the app
- Better quality tools for actual training</p>
